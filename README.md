# type-tap-tango

Create an app where there is a keyboard and letters are flying in through the keyboard and you have to press the key at the right moment when the matching letter is under that key. So the letter R may be flying in from the left on the second row (where the R is on a qwerty keyboard) and you have to press R right when the flying letter is under that key
